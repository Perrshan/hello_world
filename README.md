# Overview

This software is a simple, beginning code milestone where I am printing "Hello World" in the rust language.

I am learning the rust language to further my skills in computer programming and am planning on increasing my skills to create a more in depth project using Rust.

# Development Environment

I used Virtual Studio Code as the environment for my code, and used a windows terminal to execute the code. Used this link to start my first project in Rust along with the second link to download the Rust Analyzer:

The [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) Programming language was used for this project.
